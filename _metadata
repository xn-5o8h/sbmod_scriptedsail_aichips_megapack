  "description" : "This mod is a pack that should contain all the A.I. chips in this collection -> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=947429656\nThey're to be used with my Scripted S.A.I.L. mod. For more informations, go check there.\nAll credits go to their respective creators, which are mentionned in the individual mods listed the above collection.\n\nAll of those are craftable via the \"Open A.I. chip crafting\" button in S.A.I.L.'s config menu, which you can open by clicking the little wrench on the top right.\n\nI feel like this is redundant with the collection, but it seems people prefer to have one big mod rather than plenty of tiny ones, so here you go!",
